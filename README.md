## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am 10th semester Biomedical Engineering student at University of West Attica and member of IEEE SB as well. I am really interested in research with primary topics biomedical (and non) control systems , optimization and mathematical modeling of real-world dynamic systems and computational intelligence techniques.Also , currently working on Tzaneio General Hospital as biomedical engineer and specific at sleep study devices part. As final part of my undergraduate studies Iâ€™m currently working on my Thesis project focused on automatic control and computational intelligence on Artificial Pancreas systems

My major areas of interest are
- Control Systems Theory
- Optimization (PSO / GA )
- Signal Processing 
- Mathematical Modeling
- Designing digital sensors
- Computation Intelligence
